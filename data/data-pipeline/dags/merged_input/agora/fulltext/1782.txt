 Introduced  by Sen. GONZALEZ -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
   printed to be committed to the Committee on Internet and Technology
 
 AN ACT to amend the civil rights law and the executive law, in  relation
   to the use of artificial intelligence systems
 
   THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
   Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited as the  "New  York
 artificial intelligence act (New York AI act)".
   ยง  2.  Legislative  findings  and  intent.  The  legislature finds and
 declares the following:
   (a) A revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) has advanced  to  the
 point  that  comprehensive  regulations  must  be enacted to protect New
 Yorkers.
   (b) Artificial intelligence is already an integral part of  New  York-
 ers' daily lives. In the private sector, AI is currently in use in areas
 such  as  education, health care, employment, insurance, credit scoring,
 public safety, retail, banking and financial services, media,  and  more
 with  little transparency or oversight. A growing body of research shows
 that AI systems that are deployed without adequate  testing,  sufficient
 oversight and robust guardrails can harm consumers and deny historically
 disadvantaged  groups  the full measure of their civil rights and liber-
 ties, thereby further entrenching inequalities. The legislature must act
 to ensure that all uses of AI, especially those  that  affect  important
 life  chances,  are  free  from harmful biases, protect our privacy, and
 work for the public good.
   (c) Safe innovation must remain a priority for  the  state.  New  York
 state is home to thousands of technology start-ups, many of which exper-
 iment  with  new applications of AI and which have the potential to find
 new ways to employ technology at the service of New Yorkers. The goal of
 the legislature is to encourage safe innovation  in  the  AI  sector  by
 providing  clear  guidance  for  AI development, testing, and validation
 both before a product is launched  and  throughout  the  product's  life
 cycle.
   (d) New York must establish that the burden of responsibility of prov-
 ing that AI products do not cause harm to New Yorkers will be shouldered
 by the developers and deployers of AI. While government and civil socie-
 ty must act to audit and enforce human rights laws around the use of AI,
 the  companies  employing  and profiting from the use of AI must lead in
 ensuring that their products are free from algorithmic discrimination.
   (e) Close collaboration and communication between New York  state  and
 industry  partners  is  key  to  ensuring that innovation can occur with
 safeguards to protect all New Yorkers. This legislation will ensure that
 lines of communication exist and that there is clear statutory authority
 to investigate and prosecute entities that break the law.
   (f) As new forms of AI are developed beyond what is currently  techno-
 logically  feasible,  the goal of the legislature is to use this section
 as a guiding light for future regulations.
   (g) Lastly, it is in the interest of all New Yorkers that certain uses
 of AI that infringe on fundamental rights, deepen structural inequality,
 or that result in unequal access to services shall be banned.
   ยง 3. The civil rights law is amended by adding a new  article  8-A  to
 read as follows:
